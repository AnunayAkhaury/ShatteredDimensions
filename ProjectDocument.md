## Gameplay Explanation ##

**In this section, explain how the game should be played. Treat this as a manual within a game. Explaining the button mappings and the most optimal gameplay strategy is encouraged.**

Shattered Dimensions is a 4 level game, and requires players to be skilled in various types of gaming styles. Once players begin the game, they will enter the Prison/Lobby where there are 4 entrances to each of the different levels. The controls and play style of each level is explained below:

### Platformer ###

The objective of the platformer is to move through the level and reach the end without hitting any of the obstacles and within the given life count per level within the platformer. The player will initially be taken to a difficulty selector screen where they can choose how many lives they want per level. To move the player, use the default WASD and ARROW KEYS with an additional input on the space key that executes jump as well. The keys will perform, move_left, move_right, jump, and crouch. Level specific controls/strategies are explained below.

Level 1:
This is a static screen level with no camera movement. Players will traverse from bottom left to top right going in a zig zag fashion. There are moving platforms, spikes, and special mechanics. The blue orb indicates a double jump: When the player is on the blue orb, they must click the jump input once again to have a second jump middair. The orange orb indicates that the platform below will ascend when the player is touching the orange orb. This can be used to reach platforms that are too high to jump to. Getting to the blue portal on the top right shifts the player to level 2.

Level 2:
This level is not static and has camera movement, but is essentially the same. The mechanics are the same with a green orb indicating descend rather than ascend. There are complex enemies like a pea shooter, and a Thwomp(mario) type of spike box. There are also obstacles like a arrow trap and also a crushing ceiling section. Moving to the right and reaching the final door takes players to Level 3.

Level 3:
Move to the top right and collect the key. You deserve it!

### Run and Gun ###

### Car Level ###

### Spaceship Level ###


**Add it here if you did work that should be factored into your grade but does not fit easily into the proscribed roles! Please include links to resources and descriptions of game-related material that does not fit into roles here.**

# External Code, Ideas, and Structure #

If your project contains code that: 1) your team did not write, and 2) does not fit cleanly into a role, please document it in this section. Please include the author of the code, where to find the code, and note which scripts, folders, or other files that comprise the external contribution. Additionally, include the license for the external code that permits you to use it. You do not need to include the license for code provided by the instruction team.

If you used tutorials or other intellectual guidance to create aspects of your project, include reference to that information as well.

# Main Roles #

Your goal is to relate the work of your role and sub-role in terms of the content of the course. Please look at the role sections below for specific instructions for each role.

Below is a template for you to highlight items of your work. These provide the evidence needed for your work to be evaluated. Try to have at least four such descriptions. They will be assessed on the quality of the underlying system and how they are linked to course content. 

*Short Description* - Long description of your work item that includes how it is relevant to topics discussed in class. [link to evidence in your repository](https://github.com/dr-jam/ECS189L/edit/project-description/ProjectDocumentTemplate.md)

Here is an example:  
*Procedural Terrain* - The game's background consists of procedurally generated terrain produced with Perlin noise. The game can modify this terrain at run-time via a call to its script methods. The intent is to allow the player to modify the terrain. This system is based on the component design pattern and the procedural content generation portions of the course. [The PCG terrain generation script](https://github.com/dr-jam/CameraControlExercise/blob/513b927e87fc686fe627bf7d4ff6ff841cf34e9f/Obscura/Assets/Scripts/TerrainGenerator.cs#L6).

You should replay any **bold text** with your relevant information. Liberally use the template when necessary and appropriate.

## Producer

**Describe the steps you took in your role as producer. Typical items include group scheduling mechanisms, links to meeting notes, descriptions of team logistics problems with their resolution, project organization tools (e.g., timelines, dependency/task tracking, Gantt charts, etc.), and repository management methodology.**

## User Interface and Input

**Describe your user interface and how it relates to gameplay. This can be done via the template.**
**Describe the default input configuration.**

**Add an entry for each platform or input style your project supports.**

## Movement/Physics

**Describe the basics of movement and physics in your game. Is it the standard physics model? What did you change or modify? Did you make your movement scripts that do not use the physics system?**

## Animation and Visuals

**List your assets, including their sources and licenses.**

**Describe how your work intersects with game feel, graphic design, and world-building. Include your visual style guide if one exists.**

## Game Logic

**Document the game states and game data you managed and the design patterns you used to complete your task.**

# Sub-Roles

## Audio

**List your assets, including their sources and licenses.**

**Describe the implementation of your audio system.**

**Document the sound style.** 

## Gameplay Testing

**Add a link to the full results of your gameplay tests.**

**Summarize the key findings from your gameplay tests.**

## Narrative Design

**Document how the narrative is present in the game via assets, gameplay systems, and gameplay.** 

## Press Kit and Trailer

**Include links to your presskit materials and trailer.**

**Describe how you showcased your work. How did you choose what to show in the trailer? Why did you choose your screenshots?**

## Game Feel and Polish

**Document what you added to and how you tweaked your game to improve its game feel.**
