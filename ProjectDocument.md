# Shattered Dimensions #

## Summary ##
Shattered Dimensions is a prison escape game focused on a space explorer who has been trapped in a dimensional prison. In order for him to escape, he must venture through the 4 dimensional gates and retrieve the 4 keys which come from each separate dimension. Each dimension is a different type of level with a unique style including a platformer level, run and gun level, car level, and spaceship level. Once players beat each level to retrieve the special keys, they can escape the prison and win the game. Do you have what it takes to escape this dimensional prison? Enter the cosmos and find out.

## Gameplay Explanation ##

**In this section, explain how the game should be played. Treat this as a manual within a game. Explaining the button mappings and the most optimal gameplay strategy is encouraged.**

Shattered Dimensions is a 4 level game, and requires players to be skilled in various types of gaming styles. Once players begin the game, they will enter the Prison/Lobby where there are 4 entrances to each of the different levels. The controls and play style of each level is explained below:

### Platformer ###

The objective of the platformer is to move through the level and reach the end without hitting any of the obstacles and within the given life count per level within the platformer. The player will initially be taken to a difficulty selector screen where they can choose how many lives they want per level. To move the player, use the default WASD and ARROW KEYS with an additional input on the space key that executes jump as well. The keys will perform, move_left, move_right, jump, and crouch. Level specific controls/strategies are explained below.

Level 1:
This is a static screen level with no camera movement. Players will traverse from bottom left to top right going in a zig zag fashion. There are moving platforms, spikes, and special mechanics. The blue orb indicates a double jump: When the player is on the blue orb, they must click the jump input once again to have a second jump middair. The orange orb indicates that the platform below will ascend when the player is touching the orange orb. This can be used to reach platforms that are too high to jump to. Getting to the blue portal on the top right shifts the player to level 2.

Level 2:
This level is not static and has camera movement, but is essentially the same. The mechanics are the same with a green orb indicating descend rather than ascend. There are complex enemies like a pea shooter, and a Thwomp(mario) type of spike box. There are also obstacles like a arrow trap and also a crushing ceiling section. Moving to the right and reaching the final door takes players to Level 3.

Level 3:
Move to the top right and collect the key. You deserve it!

### Run and Gun ###

### Car Level ###

### Spaceship Level ###

The objective of this level is for the player's spaceship to reach the end of the space domain without fatal damage and kill a minimum of 5 UFOs in its path. The player can use the up, down, and right keys for movement and press D for a quick boost. The player takes damage upon collision with an asteroid or from being hit by a blast from the UFO. The player statistics in the top right corner displays a health bar and a count for the number of UFOs the player still has to defeat. When the player successfully reaches the end of the level, they can pick up their golden key!

**Add it here if you did work that should be factored into your grade but does not fit easily into the proscribed roles! Please include links to resources and descriptions of game-related material that does not fit into roles here.**

# External Code, Ideas, and Structure #

If your project contains code that: 1) your team did not write, and 2) does not fit cleanly into a role, please document it in this section. Please include the author of the code, where to find the code, and note which scripts, folders, or other files that comprise the external contribution. Additionally, include the license for the external code that permits you to use it. You do not need to include the license for code provided by the instruction team.

If you used tutorials or other intellectual guidance to create aspects of your project, include reference to that information as well.

# Main Roles #

Your goal is to relate the work of your role and sub-role in terms of the content of the course. Please look at the role sections below for specific instructions for each role.

Below is a template for you to highlight items of your work. These provide the evidence needed for your work to be evaluated. Try to have at least four such descriptions. They will be assessed on the quality of the underlying system and how they are linked to course content. 

*Short Description* - Long description of your work item that includes how it is relevant to topics discussed in class. [link to evidence in your repository](https://github.com/dr-jam/ECS189L/edit/project-description/ProjectDocumentTemplate.md)

Here is an example:  
*Procedural Terrain* - The game's background consists of procedurally generated terrain produced with Perlin noise. The game can modify this terrain at run-time via a call to its script methods. The intent is to allow the player to modify the terrain. This system is based on the component design pattern and the procedural content generation portions of the course. [The PCG terrain generation script](https://github.com/dr-jam/CameraControlExercise/blob/513b927e87fc686fe627bf7d4ff6ff841cf34e9f/Obscura/Assets/Scripts/TerrainGenerator.cs#L6).

You should replay any **bold text** with your relevant information. Liberally use the template when necessary and appropriate.

## Spaceship Level

*Autoscroll Camera Movement with Partital PushBox* - The camera movement of the game is a combination of different features of 
the pushbox and controllers in Exercise 2. The camera is set to perform a constant horizontal autoscroll and the player 
(spaceship) is pushed by the left edge of the pushbox. The player is restricted from moving to the right past the dimensions of 
the screen to allow a view of the spaceship at all times. The player is free to move vertically until they reach the bounds of 
the background. 

*Arrow & Blast Instantiation Systems* - Upon the press of the space bar, the spaceship instantiates a new set of arrows that 
are loaded onto the spaceship and fired at the incoming UFOs. Each arrow is released at a different time in line with the 
animation of the fire and operates independently of the rest once all the arrows are released. The enemy UFOs have a similar 
system with blasts, where they automatically instantiate blasts with a constant delay once the UFO is within the camera 
viewport. These blasts are also equipped with animation and cause damage to the spaceship upon collision. These systems are 
based upon the projectile instantiation demonstrated in Exercise 3. 

*Spaceship Movement and Statistics* - The movement of the spaceship is directly dependent upon the pressing of the up, down, and right keys. Damage of the spaceship is handled by the healthLevel variable that is updated based on different collisions and the health is constantly displayed in the top right corner by the use of a health bar. The UFOs have their own health which is depleted by the arrows fired by the spaceship. The spaceship.gd script also keeps track of the number of UFOs defeated. My implementation of the spaceship demonstrates my learning from Exercise 1 with the character and boss.
